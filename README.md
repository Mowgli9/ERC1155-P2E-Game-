# -----Crypto Shinobi-----

    Gameplay  `PVE` :

        Ther's 6 enemies from the `Akatsuki` each one of them has a number of `Chakra`.
        So you need to hold `Shinobis` and create a `Team` between 2 and 5 numbers. When you 
        combine your `Shinobis` power you will get `Chakra`.
        The main mission is fight the `Akatsuki` membres, every membre of them require a minimum `Chakra`, and more `Chakra` you have more chance to win.
        after the fight you need to play a litle bit of $RYO (see #What is $RYO) to villagers to fix the fight damage :).
         Ps : each one of members has different fight damage.

    What you need to play ?

        - You will need to be a `Shinobi` holder (see #How to buy nft).

    In game requirement :

        - You will need first to create a `Team` between 2 and 5 `Shinobis`.
            Ps : you pay to create team one team for ever.
        - You need to pay 10 dollar in $RYO token ).
        - After every fight you need to pay 1.5 dollar in $RYO

    In game conditions :

        - `Shinobi` can fight only one time per 24h.
        - Every membre of the `Akatuski` has minimum requirement of `Chakra` (see #Akatsuki)

    Example of gameplay :

        I have a 3 `Shinobis` ---> I will create a `Team` ---> I'll pay 10 dollars of $RYO---> now my `Team` `Chakra` is 250 ---> I'll choose `Sasori` because you can fight with him if you have `Chakra` more than 2q0 ---> `Sasori` `Chakra` is 250 so I have the chance of 80 % to win this fight ---> I fight ---> boom I get the reward ---> I pay fight damage ---> I wait 10 days to claim.

# @developers :

    ##### BIG IMPORTANT ######

    To test timing / pricing per example 
    you need to wait 25 days to do something, you can change the smart contract to be 
    25 seconds and use time.sleep() before run the command.
    Pricing increase or decrease the value just for test 
    I USE THIS METHODS SO IF YOU FIND ANY VALUE NEED TO CHANGE TELL ME IN DISCORD.

    I use different method in testing, I test code as script.
    If you want to ask about something or purpose to add something, Mowgli#7713
    —scripts/test this folder contains files to test.
    —scripts, contains files to interact with the smart contract if you want to ask about something Mowgli#7713


    - I test every function in contract on mainnet-fork using a random number with python 
        not chainlink 
        * you can do the same if you want to test on mainnet-fork without use chainlink
        node response
    
    —Then I changed the code to be compatible with chainlink node on rinkeby 

    This is a lot of Bla bla bla but if you have a question or a place in project for me :)
